### Conflict Resolution

- What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
  - Talk about it if it doesn't feel even and bring in a third party if needed.
- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
  - Talk through any concerns and redistribute the work load -- third party as needed.
- How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
  - We can do our best to bring the other person up to speed. Treat each circumstance as an opportunity to learn or to mentor to cement own knowledge.
